# WTF is this ???

Just two simples scripts for people like me who are too lazy to write when using [this guide](https://github.com/Ataraxxia/secure-arch/blob/main/00_basic_system_installation.md) for your ultimate secure arch install.

## Important

Do not use the first script while chrooted in your system.

The second script is intended to be used when you have rebooted and you have to setup sbctl.

## Why is this writen like garbage ?

Sry idk how to write a good script and im way too lazy to learn rn...
